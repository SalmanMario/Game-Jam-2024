octaviusCharacter (default): JaggedMaws? I thought they were just a myth.

octaviusCharacter (default): Don’t worry. I will help you. But first, I need to understand more about them. Where do they come from?
sharkCharacter (default): They emerged from the Abyssal Trench, a dark and dangerous place where no one dares to go.
